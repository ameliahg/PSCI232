# ANES data

ANES is the American National Election Study, a massive survey that has been run every election year since 1948. There are two main data sources here: The ANES time series file, containing all respondents ever (!!!) and the 2016 ANES pilot data. The former is usually what I will ask you to use. The latter serves as the replication material for Phillip Klinkner's work on racial resentment, misinformation, and Trump voting in the 2016 primaries.
